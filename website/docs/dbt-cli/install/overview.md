title: "Installing dbt"
---

dbt is a python program that can be installed locally for development. Your installation will differ based on the database, data lake, or query engine that you wish to use with dbtâ€”we call those "adapters," and you can see [the full list](available-adapters).

If you know which adapter plugin you wish to use, we recommend installing that adapter specifically [using pip](install/pip#install-a-specific-adapter):

```
pip install dbt-postgres
```

If you're just getting started, or if don't know which adapter you'll be using, we recommend installing dbt using one of four tried-and-tested methods:

- [Homebrew](install/homebrew) (recommended for MacOS)
- [pip](install/pip)
- [Docker image](install/docker)
- [from source](install/from-source)
